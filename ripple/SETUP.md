# Ripple — from demo to public messenger

Ripple ships in two layers so it's genuinely useful the moment you open it, and
genuinely deployable when you're ready for real users.

## ✨ Pulse — the one thing no other messenger does

Open any chat and look just under the name: a live **rhythm strip** reads the
*tempo* of that specific relationship straight from the message timestamps —
on-device, no servers, no ML — and distils it into a single living **beat**
(⚡ Rapid · warming up · ~30s beat · sync 82). It tracks cadence, momentum
(warming / cooling / resting), who's leading, and an in-sync score.

The beat powers a brand-new messaging primitive: **time measured in
conversational beats instead of clock seconds.** Set a chat to disappear "in 1
beat" and each message lives exactly *one of your volleys* — seconds in a
rapid-fire chat, a day in a slow burn — because the timer breathes with the two
people in the conversation rather than an arbitrary wall-clock. Tap the strip to
see the full read and pick a beat timer.

Pulse also reads two more things from the same timestamps:

- **Best time to reach** — a recency-weighted hour-of-day model of when the other
  person is usually active (`replyOutlook()`), surfaced on the strip
  (🟢 around now / 🕓 9 PM) and as a 24-hour histogram in the Pulse sheet.
- **Rhythm-aware quiet hours** — when a 1:1 partner is usually quiet right now, a
  one-tap bar above the composer offers to hold your message until their next
  peak hour (`nextPeakTime()`), so you don't ping into the void. It reuses the
  scheduling pipeline.
- **Tempo-matching Echo** — the built-in demo bot (`echoReplyDelay()`) replies
  fast when you volley fast and lingers when you slow down, so the rhythm read
  feels alive the moment you start typing.
- **Group Pulse** — in a group, the Pulse sheet shows the liveliest hour and
  **who carries the room** (recency-weighted share bars) via `groupPulse()`.

The algorithms live in [`engine.js`](./engine.js) (`conversationPulse`,
`replyOutlook`, `nextPeakTime`, `groupPulse`, `echoReplyDelay`), covered by unit
tests in [`../scripts/test-ripple-logic.mjs`](../scripts/test-ripple-logic.mjs).

## 1. What works with zero setup (today)

Open [`ripple/index.html`](./index.html) — no build, no account:

- **Real messaging UX** — chat list, conversations, day dividers, delivery/read
  ticks, typing indicators, reactions, replies, **edit**, **unsend**, star, pin,
  mute, archive, search across every chat.
- **Differentiators over WhatsApp** — **schedule** a message for later,
  **disappearing messages** with a per-chat timer, inline **polls**, **slash
  commands** (`/poll`, `/remind`, `/expire`, `/me`, `/shrug`, `/shout`, `/clear`),
  rich text (`*bold*`, `_italic_`, `~strike~`, `` `code` ``), voice notes, photos.
- **Echo**, a built-in auto-responder, replies to you so the app feels alive
  without anyone else online.
- **Multi-tab live sync** — open Ripple in two browser tabs/windows; they stay in
  sync over `BroadcastChannel`. Your data is persisted on-device in `localStorage`.
- **App Lock** — optionally encrypt everything on the device with a passphrase
  (AES-GCM, PBKDF2-derived key, 150k iterations). The key is never stored.
- **Installable PWA** — Add to Home Screen for a full-screen, offline app.

The **product logic** (search ranking, disappearing/scheduled dispatch, reaction
toggling, poll tally, sidebar summaries, sync de-duplication) lives in
[`engine.js`](./engine.js) and is covered by `npm run test:ripple`.

## 2. Going multi-user — real people, real devices (built in)

The cloud transport is **already wired** — it just needs a backend. Out of the
box Ripple talks to **Firebase** (Anonymous Auth + Firestore). Turn it on:

1. **Add your config** — open [`config.js`](./config.js) and replace `null` with
   your Firebase web config. (You can reuse the project in
   [`../firebase.js`](../firebase.js) — paste the same object.)
2. **Enable Anonymous sign-in** — Firebase console → Authentication → Sign-in
   method → **Anonymous**.
3. **Deploy the rules** — [`../firestore.rules`](../firestore.rules) now contains
   a `ripple_*` section that restricts every chat to its members:
   ```sh
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

That's it. On next load Ripple signs the user in anonymously, and **New chat →
Sync to cloud** creates a real-time chat. Hit **🔗 Share invite link** (in the
chat's ⋮ info, or right after creating it) and send it to anyone — opening the
link (`…/ripple/?join=<chatId>`) joins them to the chat. Messages, edits,
unsends, reactions, poll votes and read receipts all sync live via Firestore
`onSnapshot`. Disappearing and scheduled messages stay client-evaluated.

### Data model (what the app reads/writes)

```
ripple_users/{uid}                      → { name, avatar, updatedAt }
ripple_chats/{chatId}                   → { type, name, avatar, members:[uid],
                                            disappearSec, lastText, updatedAt }
ripple_chats/{chatId}/messages/{msgId}  → the Message shape from engine.js
                                          (id, senderId, text, ts, type,
                                           reactions, replyTo, editedAt, deleted,
                                           expireAt, scheduledAt, readBy, meta)
```

`Ripple.mergeMessages(local, remote)` is available for any place you'd rather
reconcile than replace wholesale (it de-dupes by id, prefers the newest edit,
lets a delete win, keeps `ts` order — the unit tests pin this).

### End-to-end encryption (already wired — DMs and groups)

- Each device holds an **ECDH P-256** identity key. Its public half is published
  to `ripple_users/<uid>.pubKey`; the private half never leaves the device
  (stored locally, encrypted at rest when **App Lock** is on).
- **1:1 chats** derive a shared **AES-GCM-256** key directly via ECDH over the
  two public keys — no key storage at all.
- **Group chats** use a shared per-chat AES key. A single elected **key-owner**
  (the creator, or the first opener via a transaction) generates it and **wraps a
  copy for every member** with ECDH, stored ciphertext-only in
  `ripple_chats/<id>/keys/<uid>`. New members are wrapped a copy when the owner
  next opens the chat. The plaintext key never reaches the server.
- Either way, message **text** is encrypted client-side: the server stores only
  ciphertext (`m.enc = {v,iv,ct}`, `text:''`), the chat's `lastText` becomes
  `🔒 Message`, and the push body shows `🔒 New message`. Plaintext is decrypted
  into memory for display/search only. The header shows **🔒** and a banner
  confirms it.
- **Fail-safe:** if any key isn't available yet (a member hasn't published a key,
  or the owner is offline), that message gracefully falls back to plaintext / a
  `🔒 waiting for a key` placeholder — encryption never breaks the chat.
- **Honest scope:** text only (media/polls aren't encrypted yet), one identity
  key per device (no multi-device key sync), and no post-compromise key rotation
  — real ECDH+AES E2EE, not yet a production Signal-grade system.

### Direct connect by username (no link needed)

Pick a **username** in Settings and you're listed in a public `ripple_directory`
(handle → uid/name/avatar). In **New chat → "Add someone by username"**, type
their handle and **Connect**: Ripple creates the 1:1 chat and drops an invite in
`ripple_invites`. The other person sees a **contact request** (👋 badge in the
sidebar) and can **Accept** (joins the chat) or **Decline** (removes the invite) —
no link to copy. Each side sees the *other* person's name/avatar (resolved
per-viewer). Rules: directory is world-readable but you can only claim a handle
pointing at yourself; invites are readable/removable only by the two parties.

You can also show a **QR code** of your username (New chat → *Show my QR code*).
It encodes an `?add=<handle>` deep link — scanning it opens Ripple and sends you a
contact request. The QR is generated entirely on-device by
[`qr.js`](./qr.js) (a dependency-free encoder; structurally unit-tested in
[`../scripts/test-ripple-qr.mjs`](../scripts/test-ripple-qr.mjs)).

### Invite tokens (closed by default)

New cloud chats carry a random **`joinCode`** included in the invite link
(`?join=<id>&k=<code>`). The Firestore rules require a joiner to present the
matching token (`joinProof`) to add themselves — so knowing the chat id alone is
no longer enough to join. Chats created before this stay open for backward
compatibility.

### Voice & video calls (already wired)

1:1 cloud chats get **📞 voice** and **📹 video** buttons in the conversation
header. Calls are **peer-to-peer WebRTC**: Firestore (`ripple_calls/<id>`) only
relays the SDP offer/answer and ICE candidates — the audio/video never touches a
server. Public Google STUN handles most networks; a strict/corporate NAT would
need a **TURN** server added to the `ICE` config. Incoming calls ring on any
screen (a listener on `where('callee','==', me)`), with accept/decline, mute,
camera toggle and a call timer. Rules restrict each call's signaling to its two
parties.

### Media & typing (already wired)

- **Media → Storage** — in a synced chat, photos and voice notes upload to
  **Firebase Storage** under `ripple/<chatId>/<msgId>` and only the download URL
  is stored on the message, so media never hits the 1 MB Firestore doc limit.
  Deploy the Storage rules alongside Firestore:
  ```sh
  firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage
  ```
  ([`../storage.rules`](../storage.rules) caps uploads at 12 MB and restricts to
  image/audio; tighten to per-chat membership via a Cloud Function before launch.)
- **Live typing** — typing state is written to
  `ripple_chats/<chatId>/typing/<uid>` (throttled, auto-expiring after ~6s) so
  members see "typing…" in real time. You write only your own doc (enforced in
  the rules).
- **Server-side dispatch** — two functions in [`../functions/index.js`](../functions/index.js)
  make delivery correct even when the author's device is offline:
  - `rippleMaintenance` (1-minute cron) **releases scheduled messages** when their
    time comes and **hard-deletes expired disappearing messages** so they truly
    vanish server-side, not just hidden on each client.
  - `ripplePushOnMessage` pushes the moment a message becomes deliverable — on
    create *or* when a scheduled message is released — so a scheduled send still
    notifies. (Scheduled messages are now written to Firestore at compose time,
    held by `scheduledAt > now`, and clients hide them until released.)

  The cron needs the **Cloud Scheduler** API enabled (Firebase enables it on first
  deploy of a scheduled function).
- **Push notifications** — `ripplePushOnMessage` pushes to every other member's
  devices via FCM. Tokens live in the private `ripple_push/<uid>` collection
  (owner-only by rules; the function reads them with the Admin SDK). The Ripple
  service worker doubles as the FCM background worker. To turn it on:
  1. Firebase console → Project settings → **Cloud Messaging** → **Web Push
     certificates** → copy the public **Key pair** and paste it as
     `RIPPLE_FCM_VAPID_KEY` in [`config.js`](./config.js).
  2. Deploy everything:
     ```sh
     firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage,functions
     ```
  3. In Ripple → **Settings → Push notifications** to grant permission and
     register the device. Notifications arrive even when the app is closed.

### Production hardening (recommended before opening sign-ups)

- **Stronger invites** — `joinCode` tokens gate joins today; for revocable or
  expiring invites, rotate the code (a Cloud Function can issue short-lived ones).
